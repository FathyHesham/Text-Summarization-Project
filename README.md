Welcome to the **Text Summarization Project** repository! This project focuses on developing an efficient and accurate text summarization system using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The goal is to provide a tool that automatically generating concise and meaningful summaries from large text documents, making extracting key information easier.

## Overview
This project is a **Text Summarization System** developed using **NLP techniques** and **deep learning models**. The system is designed to generate summaries from large text documents, such as articles, research papers, or reports. The project leverages state-of-the-art NLP models to ensure high-quality and coherent summaries.

---

## Motivation
In today's information-rich world, processing large volumes of text can be time-consuming and overwhelming. Text summarization helps by:
- **Saving Time**: Quickly extracting key points from lengthy documents.
- **Improving Efficiency**: Allowing users to focus on the most important information.
- **Enhancing Accessibility**: Making complex documents easier to understand for a wider audience.

This project aims to provide a reliable and efficient tool for text summarization, benefiting students, researchers, and professionals alike.

---

## Features
- **Extractive Summarization**: Extracts the most important sentences from the text to create a summary.
- **Abstractive Summarization**: Generates new sentences that capture the essence of the original text.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for uploading text and receiving summaries.
- **High-Quality Summaries**: Utilizes advanced NLP models to ensure coherent and meaningful summaries.
- **Customizable Summary Length**: Users can specify the desired length of the summary.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **NLP Libraries**: NLTK, SpaCy, Gensim
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Pre-trained Models**: BERT, GPT
- **Web Development**: Flask (for backend), HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript **or** Streamlit
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy

---

## Dataset
The project uses publicly available datasets for training and testing the summarization models. Some of the datasets include:
- **CNN/Daily Mail Dataset**: A widely used dataset for text summarization tasks.
- **BBC News Dataset**: Contains news articles with human-written summaries.
- **PubMed Dataset**: A collection of scientific articles with abstracts.

The datasets are preprocessed to remove noise and ensure consistency before being used for model training.

---

## How It Works
1. **Text Input**: Users upload or paste the text they want to summarize.
2. **Preprocessing**: The text is cleaned and tokenized to prepare it for the summarization model.
3. **Model Prediction**: The text is fed into the summarization model, which generates a summary.
4. **Result Display**: The system displays the generated summary along with key statistics (e.g., summary length, compression ratio).

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FathyHesham/Text-Summarization-Project.git
   cd Text-Summarization-Project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the Web Interface**:
   Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to use the application.

---

## Usage
1. **Home Page**: Start by clicking the "Start" button.
2. **Text Input Page**: Paste or upload the text you want to summarize.
3. **Summary Page**: The system will process the text and display the generated summary.
4. **Customization**: Adjust the summary length using the provided options.

---

## Results
The system generates high-quality summaries with a focus on coherence and relevance. Below is an example of a generated summary:

**Original Text**:
```
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The dog, being lazy, did not react. The fox continued its journey through the forest.
```

**Generated Summary**:
```
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog and continues its journey through the forest.
```

---

## Future Work
1. **Improve Abstractive Summarization**: Enhance the model's ability to generate more human-like summaries.
2. **Support for Multiple Languages**: Extend the system to support text summarization in multiple languages.
3. **Integration with APIs**: Allow users to summarize text directly from web pages or documents via API integration.
4. **Real-Time Summarization**: Develop a real-time summarization feature for live text streams.
